# LinuxFilePicker

Mod which uses **kdialog**, **zenity**, or **yad** to open a file picker dialog.

You need to install one of them from the package manager of your Linux distro before using this mod.

(Also it uses d-bus to open folders in specific locations)

**Steam Flatpak users:** make sure you're running Steam with **appropriate permissions** (all filesystem and dbus)!
